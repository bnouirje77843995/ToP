### How Does GPS Phone Tracking Work?
GPS tracking works by using satellite signals and cellular tower triangulation to pinpoint the location of a phone. There are three primary methods used to track a phone’s location:
1. **GPS-Based Tracking** – Uses built-in GPS technology to provide real-time location data.
2. **Cell Tower Triangulation** – Estimates the phone’s location based on the nearest cell towers.
3. **Wi-Fi and IP Tracking** – Determines location based on nearby Wi-Fi networks and IP addresses.

Tracking a phone without permission is generally illegal unless:
- **You are tracking your own lost or stolen phone.**
- **Parents are monitoring their minor children’s devices.**
- **Employers are tracking company-owned phones with consent.**

Unauthorized tracking of someone’s phone without their consent can lead to legal consequences, including fines and criminal charges.
