### Is It Legal to Track a Phone Number Without Permission?
Before using any tracking tool, it’s crucial to understand the legality of such actions. In most countries, tracking a phone without the owner’s consent is illegal unless you have legitimate reasons, such as:
- **Parental Control**: Parents can track their minor children’s phones for safety purposes.
- **Lost or Stolen Phone**: You can track your own lost or stolen phone.
- **Business Monitoring**: Employers may track company-owned devices with employees’ prior consent.

Using tracking tools on someone else’s phone without consent can lead to serious legal consequences.
